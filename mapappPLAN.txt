Tackle Story Features when you're feeling creative
Save Advanced Features for when you're in deep-focus mode

Daily Approach:

Monday Energy: Quick wins or visual polish
Deep Focus Days: Foundation blocks or story features
Friday Afternoon: Visual polish or small improvements
Weekend Curiosity: Advanced features or experiments

Tracking Progress:

Keep a simple checklist (even just checkboxes in a text file)
Take screenshots of before/after for visual features
Test each feature immediately - don't let bugs pile up
