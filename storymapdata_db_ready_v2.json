When traveling through these spaces, they experience fear, uncertainty, despair, confusion, and other emotions. What outlets are they afforded to express these emotions? Would creative expressions, for example, through, poetry, creative writing, testimonios (testimonies/narratives), and pláticas (talks) provide them with opportunities to name and narrate their worlds? Do artistic undertakings create a healthier emotional and mental state for migrants and their loved ones? Can arts-based experiences at least temporarily free individuals from pain or desperation? Although media coverage of the “migrant experience” has been extensive, it has not often included the voices of migrants themselves. These activities and testimonios will be explored in a virtual mode with migrant families awaiting their asylum interview, and who are now safe in their new communities.",

In figure 33\",\" she described the horrifying acts committed by the cartel against her uncle\",\" witnessed by both her and her family. She wrote: “Lo que nosotros vivimos en carne propia\",\" fue que en mi casa levantaron a mi tío y lo descuartizaron en pedacitos\",\" le cortaron los pies\",\" manos\",\" orejas lo hicieron cachitos y nosotros estábamos con vida por un milagro\",\" por obra de Dios y eso nunca se nos va olvidar.

Why doesn’t the government do anything?]. \r\nThe woman did not feel comfortable sharing her drawing\",\" perhaps due to the personal and distressing nature of her experience. She did want for me to share it with others in our makerspace to raise awareness about the dangers of migration and the need for the support of the Mexican government. Her call-out of the government suggests a frustration with the Mexican authorities and their unwilling to protect its citizens. Her drawing depicts the cruelty and horror endured by the cartel in Mexico; as well as the urgent need for systemic change and justice.\r\n",

Working closely with the UA libraries and two community organizations, Madres Buscadoras and the Colibrí Center for Human Rights, this project will create an interactive website to highlight this work and explore forensics in the landscape of the borderlands. The site will feature three components: interviews with citizen-forensic experts, videography of the landscape in which they work, and a bi-national map displaying the GPS locations where they have found or identified human remains. This project will broaden the national and international understanding of the U.S.-Mexico borderlands by presenting a fully bi-national view of border related violence, and by making visible the leadership, expertise, and action on the part of those impacted. The story this project will tell is one about regular people in the borderlands who step up to do extraordinary work; who not only make visible violence occurring in the borderlands but also challenge the authority of the state by becoming forensic experts.",

    "DescriptionLong": "Borderland Migrations & Metaphors (BMM) is a creative inquiry that uses pláticas in combination with podcasting to produce trans-disciplinary stories of the U.S.-Mexico border. Plática is an anti-colonial feminista methodology that prioritizes social relationships based on trust, mutual vulnerability, and reciprocity. This approach contrasts power relations that characterize the traditional dichotomy of researcher-subject. BMM creates a space for co- creating knowledge through conversational interviews with BorderLab fellows from 2021-2023. Fellows are invited to reflect on their projects; how they are currently thinking about borderlands as an identity, location, and idea; and how they have been changed by borderlands research. Interviewers and fellows co-theorize as they connect everyday lived experiences with their research process. BMM conversations are recorded in a studio, thematically analyzed, sound edited, and enhanced within an iterative process. The result is a series of five podcast episodes. The BMM project will enrich public scholarship on the U.S.-Mexico border through its collective voicing of distinct insights of BorderLab fellows, its use of sound as the primary medium in which to produce knowledge, and its accessibility within and beyond the academic community. Sama Alshaibi is Regents Professor of Art at the University of Arizona's School of Art and Director of the Racial Justice Studio at Arizona Arts. An interdisciplinary visual artist, her practice explores the notion of aftermath—the fragmentation and dispossession that violates the individual and a community following the destruction of their social, natural, and built environment. Alshaibi is the 2023 Art Matters' Betty Parsons Fellow, a 2021 Guggenheim Fellow, and a 2024 Rockefeller Foundation Bellagio Center Resident. She has exhibited in numerous biennales and museums, including the 55th Venice Biennale, the 2020 State of the Art (Crystal Bridges Museum of Art, AK), the Museum of Modern Art (New York), Institut Du Monde Arabe (Paris) and Barjeel Foundation (U.A.E.), among others. In 2015, Aperture published her monograph Sama Alshaibi: Sand Rushes In.",

    "DescriptionLong": "The project MEMBRANA SEMIPERMEABLE proposes the creation of an immersive audiovisual installation and a performance piece that increase accessibility to available data about HIV/AIDS in the US/Mexico border employing cutting-edge tools for data visualization and documentary strategies. The project lends immediacy to a complex entanglement of physiological, sociopolitical, and anthropological matters related to the ongoing HIV/AIDS crisis. Health risks travel fluidly between borders. At the periphery of both countries’ economies, the region is affected by systematic social and economic disparities that co-exist with institutional racism and structural violence. In Arizona alone, HIV incidence among White individuals has had a 64% decrease from 1988 to 2020, whereas Hispanic individuals have had a 49% increase in new infections during the same period. In response to a pressing intersectional matter, the project explores queer-mestiza/o-PLWH (person living with HIV) subjectivity merging lens-based and computational strategies for image generation. This CFP Mellon-Fronteridades Faculty Fellowship application requests funds for the installation and performance design, and for the presentation of the creative work to the Tucson community. Marcos Serafim is a Brazilian artist and researcher working with imaging, video and sound across theatrical exhibition, installation, and performance. His practice investigates social and political subjects while exploring their relations to technology with the goal of producing works that are socially relevant, critical, and poetic. These subjects include: the HIV/AIDS crisis; religious African-Brazilian minorities in rural Brazil; Haitian history of revolution and social calamity; and other religiously, racially, and sexually minoritized groups. His approaches include performative situations, material encounters with digitality, resignification of archival imagery, and critical engagement with subjects, contexts, and spaces. Serafim's practice brings awareness to material and social implications of media while praising sensorial and poetic capabilities to engage viewers in reflection and critical thinking. Serafim holds a BA in Film and Video from Parana State University in Brazil, an MA in Studio Art from Eastern Illinois University, and an MFA in Studio Art from Michigan State University.",

To challenge this flood injustice, Belury have co-conceived a participatory dissertation project that leverages satellite imagery and collaboration with community-based, flood justice advocacy organizations. This project focuses on two regions of the US-Mexico border: Nogales, Sonora/Nogales, Arizona (Ambos Nogales), and the Rio Grande/Rio Bravo Delta of the Texas-Tamaulipas border. The digital humanities can improve the impact of this project, transcend the disciplinary boundaries of flood mapping, and further engage local stakeholders and the public. With the 2023 Mellon-Fronteridades Graduate Fellowship Belury will produce and host the podcast Flood Justice in the Borderlands. This bilingual podcast will be conducted in English, then repeated in Spanish, thus communicating this information to bilingual audiences. Belury will host and produce one podcast on Ambos Nogales (English/Spanish) and one podcast in the Rio Grande/Rio Bravo Delta (English/Spanish), totaling four podcast episodes. In addition, Belury will develop a website to host the podcast series and the satellite flooding imagery Belury is generating. The website and accompanying satellite imagery will increase the communication of this project to the public and enhance the podcast experience by enabling listeners to visualize the scope and impact of these flood events. This bilingual podcast is also an opportunity to interview flood justice experts in the borderlands and share their knowledge with a broad and diverse audience.

At the same time, Choi's oral histories will also explore how this vibrant commercial and cultural space was impacted by increased border militarization of the 1990s and beyond, in addition to the near closure of the border during the COVID pandemic. Choi sees Morley Avenue as a site of placemaking and cross-border flows, drawing from Choi's personal history with her own family’s shop along the border.

    "DescriptionLong": "Cordova's project, Ghosts and Shadows, is a 20-minute audio/video artwork that aims to uncover a common auditory and visual language between humans and the US/Mexico Border as immaterial/material-entity. Cordova will use this uncovering of language to interpret the agency of its material properties. Cordova wonders, what else does the material of the border wall desire to become instead of its current desecrated, masculine and phallocentric form? As a part of this project, Cordova will employ resistance strategies integral to the counter-narratives of his family’s own oral histories. The oral history central to this endeavor is that of Cordova's uncle, who was a long-time labor activist and organizer beginning with the United Farm Workers in the 1960s and 70s. The interdisciplinary performance methodologies Cordova will employ to commune with the US/Mexico Border will evade rational understanding operating at sensorial and emotional registers. Cordova will screen the final 20-minute audio/video artwork locally in Tucson in a university setting. The screening will be followed by a community engagement discussion with group reflections. Discussion questions will be framed and guided by guest scholars from the university community. Additionally, Cordova will make the work and myself available for classes and symposiums.

    "DescriptionLong": "There is an abundance of literature on foodways at the U.S-Mexican border, yet there is no concise documentation of Mexican convenience stores or “mercados'' in the southwest borderlands. This project aims to register how mercados across the border recreate their spaces, resources, and define symbolic and cultural ties to their communities. The documentation of Mexican ethnic stores has considerable implications, for one; mapping out access to different food systems which can culturally determine terms of quality, nutrition, knowledge, and a sense of belonging to one's community. In this sense, the goal of this project represents a matter of political, environmental, community health, and the importance of cultural spaces, and to explore its relation to commodity consumption of ethnic products. Through such documentation will be produced a website that will register mercados, essentially creating a cultural mapping of such spaces along the southwest border and telling their stories of how they came to be. In this context this project will point to understanding how mercados construct through symbolic, material (food and resources), the integration of these communities in their cultural surroundings, especially in border-spaces. This project will document these crucial spaces, by interrogating, how do communities in the southwest border (re)produce their cultural identities through commodity consumption, and based on this, what else is being consumed beyond the foods and materials sold in mercado spaces? Further exploring the relationship between Mexican identity and mercados and the production's experience and knowledge at the southwest border. Jazmin Gonzalez is a Master of Arts student in the Center for Latin American Studies. Her interdisciplinary research interests include Transnationalism, Borders and Migration, Environment, and Health Advocacy. Through her studies at Central Washington University in Anthropology, she has had the opportunity to conduct ethnographic research funded by the National Science Foundation in the coastal region of Mexico. Additionally, she has conducted visual ethnographies with farmworkers in the Yakima Valley, Washington State. Following her undergraduate studies, she worked during the pandemic alongside Latin American Consulates and funeral homes in the state of Washington. Currently, Jazmin combines her passion for medical and visual anthropology to shed light on better understanding how migration impacts commodities and ethnic stores or Mercado spaces, and the significance of symbolic and material elements. Jazmin is an advocate for community health, emphasizing the use of foods that hold important cultural significance in the region. Her vision for her upcoming project is to generate actionable knowledge in the field and highlight the realm of migration and community resilience.",

My work brings to life the experience of being a young, bilingual prisoner with a multi-ethnic identity split by a transnational boundary between the U.S. and Mexico, highlighting the fraught interracial dynamics of prison society, colloquially known as “prison politics.” A prime example is the distinction made between Paisas, or Mexican nationals, who are categorized as a different “race” than Raza, or Chicanos. This racial distinction, thrown into stark relief by the tension and rivalry between Raza and Paisas in prison, is impossible to reproduce in free society. Arizona’s prison culture illuminates the way that transborder ethnic identities are refracted through the lens of carceral spaces. Through autoethnographic methods of (re)locating memory as a deeply place-based experience, Olivares-Pelayo work examines the narrative of not only my own incarceration, but the stories that frame punishment and justice in the Sonoran Borderlands. Enrique Alan Olivares-Pelayo is a bilingual Tucsonan and first-generation Mexican-American. His extended family hails from Mexicali, Baja California, with roots that go back to Jalisco, Mexico. His research into the complicated racial dynamics within Arizona’s prison system are informed by four years experience incarceration, ending in 2014. He is currently pursuing a Ph.D. in geography at the School of Geography, Development, and Environment.",

    "DescriptionLong": "Undocumented migrants who traverse through Mexico face innumerable obstacles, however, there are also multiple networks in place to support them along the way. Despite extensive literature on migration on the U.S/ Mexico border, little attention has been paid to how migrant shelters can be viewed as pedagogical and transformative spaces of learning and activism. The 2023 Mellon-Fronteridades Graduate Fellowship will enable Sandoval to research the roles pedagogy and activism play within migrant shelters in Sonora, Mexico. Sandoval will spend time at various migrant shelters in Sonora and engage with the centers as pedagogical sites. She will examine the roles that knowledge sharing and learning play within migrant shelters. This research has potential for better understanding larger themes within transborder spaces and education. Sandoval's culminating projects will include 1) spatial analysis and mapping of learning practices that occur within migrant shelters in Sonora, Mexico 3)curated literacy materials for migrant shelters in Sonora, Mexico 3) professional development materials for K- 12 educators 4) a future article for dissertation and publication. Juanita Sandoval is a Ph.D. student in the Teaching Learning and Sociocultural Studies Department at the University of Arizona. She was born and raised in Albuquerque, New Mexico. She is a Spanish heritage language learner and identifies as a Chicana. In Albuquerque, Juanita was a public school teacher for ten years, where her focus was working in bilingual education and with emergent bilinguals. As an academic, she is interested in the intersections between teacher preparation programs and arts-based teaching methods, specifically to guide educators when working with diverse linguistic and cultural communities. She is also interested in working with migrant and refugee populations along the U.S./Mexico border.",

    "DescriptionLong": "This project will document, analyze, and share the stories of Chinese Americans in the Arizona-Sonora borderlands. Although there is growing attention drawn to Asian Americans in Latin American studies, the studies specifically on language, race, and identity issues of Chinese Americans in the borderlands have been relatively limited. Chinese Americans living in this area have been discriminated against throughout history. Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, Sinophobia has been reignited worldwide, including in both the United States and Mexico. Amid this unprecedented era, this project focuses on how K-12 Chinese American students construct and navigate their identities through their daily interactions with people in the borderlands. This project provides an empirical and timely account of the translingual, transcultural, and transracial experiences of the young generation of Chinese Americans. This project also investigates how people of other races perceive and position these young Chinese Americans. It is important to recognize the presence of Chinese Americans in the borderlands, not only because it covers the lacuna in the U.S.-Mexico border studies but also because the presence of Chinese Americans and the formation of communities impacted the larger Asian and Latin American communities nationwide and in Global Asia. The findings of the project will broaden the understanding of the lived experience in the U.S.-Mexico borderlands by presenting the research papers published in journals or conferences.

    "DescriptionLong": "In November 1989, the Berlin Wall came crashing down. Almost everybody in the world cheered loudly. However, within five years of its fall, the United States started building their own wall at the U.S.-Mexico border. For the past twenty-five years, a wrought-iron railing the color of blood has kept rising on top of what before was just a symbolic ranch-style fence line separating the two countries. In a few years, the harmless fence turned into a sinister 30-feet steel wall with strings of concertina wire stretched toward the sky, covering about 800 miles of the 2000-mile border. The billions of dollars spent in its construction could have supported education, healthcare, or the environment instead. The militarized structure harms some of the richest wildlife communities and oldest human settlements in North America: the wall cuts through the tribal homelands of at least seven Native American Nations in the United States, and several indigenous peoples in Mexico, separating tribe members from their relatives, sacred sites, and natural environments. Every day since the wall has been standing, people on both sides have been traveling to meet, talk, eat, touch hands, and even kiss through the openings in the iron bars. “Native Americans & The Border Wall” wishes to be a 15-20 minutes documentary that investigates the social, cultural, human, and environmental harm that the construction of the physical border wall has brought to the native peoples’ lives and homelands along the entire Southwest Border.

    "DescriptionLong": "The landscape of reproductive care in Arizona lacks providers and clinics, restricts access to services and care, and imposes fees that reduce reproductive autonomy, disproportionately impacting communities marginalized by their race, gender, sexuality, ability, citizenship status, and class. In response, birthworkers – non-medical birth companions who provide informational, physical, and emotional support to people during abortions, pregnancy, birth, and the postpartum period – are mobilizing to address gaps in reproductive healthcare provision. The Cihuapactli Collective in Tucson, Arizona is a group of Indigenous, Black, and Latinx birthworkers who offer full-spectrum reproductive care in their communities while cultivating mutual support amongst each other. Increasing the collective’s visibility has urgent implications; sharing knowledge creates reproductive care options and fosters community belonging by offering a model of solidarity building that can expand autonomy and access for marginalized communities. With the 2024 Mellon-Fronteridades Graduate Fellowship, I will collaborate with the Cihuapactli Collective to organize a visual-narrative exhibition that introduces Tucson to local birthworkers through photography and personal narratives about their relationship with birthwork. This project transcends disciplinary boundaries, blending art and storytelling to increase birthworker visibility and public engagement. It will practically advance understandings of the causes and responses to reproductive (in)justice in the U.S.-Mexico borderlands by documenting how birthworkers leverage ancestral and learned knowledges to enact community care. Overall, this collaborative exhibition will highlight the histories, heritages, and sociopolitical environments of individuals who join a collective to alleviate gaps in reproductive health care provision. Deyanira Ibarra (she/they) is a Chicana birthworker and sociocultural anthropology Ph.D. student at the University of Arizona with research interests at the intersection of reproductive autonomy, landscapes of care, and networks of solidarity in the U.S.-Mexico borderlands.

The project aims to make U.S. border security infrastructure—particularly the expanding network of surveillance towers that stretches from remote patches of desert to small towns and bustling metropolises, from residential back yards to community college campuses, and from public parks and nature preserves to private ranches across the region— more visible to public audiences in order to promote informed discussion about the social, cultural, and environmental impacts of border policing on the U.S.-Mexico borderlands. This is accomplished through a public website and a multimodal exhibition of photographs and supporting texts on the University of Arizona campus in April 2024, and longer-term outcomes including a published photography book and second public exhibition in Tucson, Arizona.

    "DescriptionLong": "The copious theorization on the logics of migration does not tell us why we have a sudden surge of population from as far away as India crossing the Arizona-Mexico border. Is journeying to the other side of the world, from ‘periphery’ to ‘core’, enough to alter their structural positionality in the world-system? What is their story that convinces them to embark on such a treacherous journey? Why are they leaving documents with which their identities can be reconstructed along the militarized border? Understanding the answers to these questions is significant because “the personal is international” and making feminist sense of this international investigation is a push towards informing feminist policy and pedagogy. Between borders moving over people and people moving over borders, there is a pedagogy of migration that is being shaped, written, and practiced by migrants from the global south. It is a pedagogy of abundant hope, agency, resistance, and social transformation, and is feminist in its counterhegemonic pushback against systemic inequality. This Participatory Action Research explores how migrants from the global south reshape the world as they write their own pedagogies into the liminal space of the southwest borderlands. This project will deliver: 1. a digital story to challenge biased narratives, 2. an article to inform feminist policy and pedagogy, and 3. arts-based artefacts authored by migrants, which might be put on an interactive feminist exhibition. The vision is to co-create spaces of healing and agency as migrants write their own humanizing feminist narratives.

    "DescriptionLong": "Choi's research project will explore through oral histories placemaking among business owners along Morley Avenue in Nogales, Arizona, a street known historically (1950s-1990s) for its commercial district catering to Mexican commercial clientele. Choi is interested in how this business district emerged, particularly in relation to Jewish and Asian American entrepreneurs. At the same time, Choi's oral histories will also explore how this vibrant commercial and cultural space was impacted by increased border militarization of the 1990s and beyond, in addition to the near closure of the border during the COVID pandemic. Choi sees Morley Avenue as a site of placemaking and cross-border flows, drawing from Choi's personal history with her own family’s shop along the border. This project moves beyond Choi's autoethnographic work to include oral histories from business-owning families along the street to gain a deeper and broader understanding of place making and belonging along the Arizona Borderlands.",

    "DescriptionLong": "Pendular Borders challenges border-crossing dynamics through what I coin as a ‘binational pendulum-like mobility’. Exploring the emotional, physical, and critical relationships that emerge in the US-Mexico border is crucial to understanding the types of kinesthetic resistance this geopolitical space produces. Pendular Borders will reveal through the practice of dance and bodily movement the multiple identities and experiences lived by women who continuously traverse the US-Mexico Border. This project will deliver 1) a dance performance; 2) a collection of visual, performed and written testimonies made available on a website; 3) an article on the community-based methodology developed for Pendular Borders, which will be part of the second chapter of my dissertation. This work portrays the ways in which stories of immigrants are part of the contemporary global history, and serves as an important example of how dance activates change and invites participation across socio-economic, political, racial and cultural backgrounds.",

Do artistic undertakings create a healthier emotional and mental state for migrants and their loved ones? Can arts-based experiences at least temporarily free individuals from pain or desperation? Although media coverage of the “migrant experience” has been extensive, it has not often included the voices of migrants themselves. These activities and testimonios will be explored in a virtual mode with migrant families awaiting their asylum interview, and who are now safe in their new communities.",

In addition, it seeks to understand migrant experiences during their journey through Mexico and crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. Further, this project will also address actions and potential legislation by organizations on behalf of migrants, taking into account asylum restrictions enacted during the Covid-19 pandemic and federal immigration policy changes during the first months of the new Biden presidency in 2021. It will also provide information about how this policy is affecting those who remain in the U.S.-Mexico borderlands, including its overall impact borderland region.",

    "DescriptionLong": "After September 11th, 2001, the United States government set borders and unauthorized migration as central themes to national security. Shortly thereafter, with the start of the war against drugs in 2006 by the Mexican government and the onset of the Great Recession in 2007, the United States strengthened measures to control unauthorized migration, violence at the Mexico-U.S. border and the havoc caused by the recession. Consequences have included the increased budget for the extension of the border wall and border surveillance; further restrictions for border crossing that have fragmented border communities; and the implementation of stricter anti-immigrant rhetoric and laws that criminalize clandestine border crossing and facilitate the removal of unauthorized migrants. This project explores how local dynamics among residents, organizations and authorities have been reconfigured since the beginning of the 2000s in Nogales Sonora/Arizona borderlands. Through interviews with local and non-local organizations and inhabitants, this work explores abrupt and gradual changes in local dynamics continuities and terminations of local and binational projects, the increase in violence in the region, the impact of growing in-transit migration, the initiatives that have arisen, and the participation or not of the local and non-local populations. This work not only informs us on how the reconfigurations in the Nogales Sonora/Arizona have affected the dynamics of the people living and working in the region, but also contributes to conversations about how to support positive responses to the current situation.",

Through the active listening and transcription of a dream archive, I have discovered the recurrent description of scenes related to family archetypes, border community struggles, gender issues and the persecution of necro-violent monsters. Through the dream archive research I will create a visual and textual lexicon that serves as both a manual and methodological framework for mapping an specific sensible political landscape: A US-Mexico Border region during the period of 2013 to 2020. This lexicon mapping practice aims to address the question of how we can translate our dreams into material forms —texts, imaging, objects, in order to be able to speak and discuss from a personal background about the manifestations of fears and desires that intersect our sensible experience as subjects. The dream archive is based on my life experience as a young woman who has lived her life on the US-Mexico border. Generating knowledge from the female experience of the global south by applying a sensitive and intimate technique is an epistemic decolonial effort.",

This will contribute to an often-omitted history of cross-border popular expressions between Mexico and New Mexico in the nineteenth century. This study bridges interdisciplinary approaches of both archival and Spanish language recovery to expand border learning in the SHL classroom. The study is twofold. One, it works to recover the indita genre from the archives at the Center for Southwest Research at the University of New Mexico (UNM) and the Gutiérrez-Hubbell Collection, both located in Albuquerque. The study will re-historicize the cross-border connections between New Mexico and Mexico through the indita genre and will contribute to borderlands scholarship with the creation of a manuscript for the Journal of Arizona History. Secondly, the study will create a digital story for intermediate heritage language students. This digital story will serve as a model for both recovery efforts during a pandemic and as a model for students to create their own digital story focused on borderlands oral traditions, popular culture and identity in the SHL classroom. I anticipate an outcome of community-driven learning rooted in social justice in which students are able to critically think about their own positionality in Arizona-Sonora cross-border dynamics through oral traditions and popular performances.",

One of the aims is to create an open resource in the form of a website with these multimodal narratives.

Instead, for the purpose of this research project, these assignments will be redesigned using a multimodal approach. A multimodal narrative is a way of composing that does not privilege just the linguistic form. Using this approach, students will have the opportunity to express their cultural and linguistic diversities through multiple modes (texts, sounds, visuals, movements and gestures). The multimodal nature of these narratives will have the potential to blossom multilingual ways of creating meaning by students, which sometimes can be difficult to achieve through traditional composing pedagogies. The process of developing their narratives, followed by the recognition they will receive by being displayed to the public, will honor the students’ life experiences, their family ties, their communities and culture.",
