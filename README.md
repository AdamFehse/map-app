# Confluencenter Story Map

An interactive story map application built with **Next.js**, **React**, **Leaflet**, and **Bootstrap**. It features a dynamic, responsive interface for exploring projects visually on a map.

**Live demo:** [https://adamfehse.github.io/map-app/](https://adamfehse.github.io/map-app/)

---

## Features

- Interactive map powered by **Leaflet** with markers for project locations.
- Dynamic project filtering and categorization.
- Responsive UI with **Bootstrap**
- Modals and accordions to display project information.
- Dark mode toggle.
- C# / ASP.NET Core - Backend API serving project data (JSON) dynamically.
- Data loaded from a local JSON file on the backend and exposed via a REST API endpoint.
- Frontend fetches project data from the backend API to ensure up-to-date information.

---

## Development & Deployment

- Frontend developed with Next.js and React.
- Backend API developed with .NET 6 minimal API.
- Data stored as JSON and served via `/api/projects` endpoint.
- To run locally:
  - Start backend server with `dotnet run` in the API project directory.
  - Run frontend with `npm run dev`.
- For production deployment:
  - Frontend can be built and deployed on GitHub Pages or some static host.
  - Backend API must be hosted separately to serve dynamic project data.
  - Frontend fetch URL should point to the hosted backend API.

---

## Notes

- SQLite or other databases can be added for scalable backend data storage if needed.
- API and frontend are loosely coupled; frontend can switch data sources by updating the fetch URL.

---

## Future Improvements

- Add authentication and authorization for managing project data.
- Integrate a cloud-hosted database.
- Implement offline caching for the frontend.
- Enhance map interactions and features/UI/UX.
- Integrate AI-powered analysis and project management features.
