When traveling through these spaces, they experience fear, uncertainty, despair, confusion, and other emotions. What outlets are they afforded to express these emotions? Would creative expressions, for example, through, poetry, creative writing, testimonios (testimonies/narratives), and pláticas (talks) provide them with opportunities to name and narrate their worlds? Do artistic undertakings create a healthier emotional and mental state for migrants and their loved ones? Can arts-based experiences at least temporarily free individuals from pain or desperation? Although media coverage of the “migrant experience” has been extensive, it has not often included the voices of migrants themselves. These activities and testimonios will be explored in a virtual mode with migrant families awaiting their asylum interview, and who are now safe in their new communities.",Art-Based Projects,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,Dissertation,La Casa de Papel: El Ruido De Tus Voces: Creating Emancipatory Spaces and Search for Well-Being in Our Borderlands,https://www.proquest.com/openview/3d2feabea337dbe306d0fc311303c213/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y,"The aim of this study was to explore if creative expression through arts-based experiences (poetry, music, painting, drawing, digital stories) assisted in the emotional and mental well-being of migrants, at least temporarily, while they were in these makerspaces of convivencia. This research was framed as qualitative arts-based research with ethnographic methods. This study centered on exploring the aspects of beauty in participants' experiences before migration, during migration, and while staying at the border. Nevertheless, there were instances where migrants felt compelled to share the challenges and dangers associated with migration. Within these spaces of convivencia, migrants were able to express and navigate their emotions through testimonios, pláticas, and artistic expressions.",Una experiencia para la paz (Ocean & Sky: An Experience for Peace),La cascada de agua azul (The blue waterfall),"This painting was created by a female from Mexico. She expressed “Me sentí feliz con la actividad y la convivencia. Me sentí feliz cuando pintaba, con muchísima paz al trasmitir liberación sobre un paisaje. Me ayudó en mi bienestar en expresar mi sencillez sobre el dibujo. Cuando pintaba, pensé en mi mamá porque siempre deseo estar en un lugar tranquilo antes de fallecer” [I felt happy with the activity and the convivencia. I felt happy when I painted, with a lot of peace when transmitting liberation over a landscape. It helped me in my well-being to express my simplicity about the drawing.

Las emociones que sentí fue paz, tranquilidad, y emoción. La actividad me ayudó mucho en mi bienestar. Cómodo porque dejas de pensar un rato por lo que estas pasando. Pensé en la playa, la tranquilidad de estar aquí. [I felt very good when creating the painting. The emotions I felt were peace, tranquility, and excitement. The activity helped me a lot in my well-being. Comfortable because you stop thinking about what you're going through for a while. I thought about the tranquility of being here on the beach].",https://confluencenter.arizona.edu/sites/default/files/2025-01/sunset.jpg,Derrumbando fronteras (Breaking Down Borders),El movimiento: The movement,"A Honduran woman depicted a brightly colored bus. When she shared her drawing, she explained that if the border would not exist as it does now, “No habría vigilancia” [there would be no surveillance]. She created a bus which symbolized movimiento (movement) for her. She envisioned the land where the border once stood as free from physical and human barriers, envisioning people walking and riding buses freely, without restrictions. She expressed that both passengers and the driver would experience great happiness in this scenario, free of borders. She mentioned that creating this piece brought her happiness and encouraged her to think positively about life. Additionally, she shared thoughts about her son, who had traveled as an unaccompanied minor to the U.S., expressing her hope for their reunion soon.",https://confluencenter.arizona.edu/sites/default/files/2025-01/movement.jpg,Derrumbando fronteras (Breaking Down Borders),Ropa roja (Red clothing),"a woman from Mexico drew a path free of obstruction, a representation of a world without borders. She included two individuals wearing red clothing, symbolizing freedom of movement, as they no longer needed ropa de camuflaje (camouflage clothing), to avoid detection. This highlights the challenges migrants encounter as they try to navigate the presence of border officials. The area where the border once stood was depicted with homes, trees, mountains, buildings, automobiles, a blue sky, and the sun, illustrating a vibrant and peaceful environment. She explained that the individuals wore red clothing to signify their newfound freedom. She mentioned that this activity prompted her to reflect on her journey to the shelter and how imagining a world without borders provided her alivio psicológico (psychological relief). This highlights the healing value of creative expression in processing emotions and experiences related to migration. She also expressed compassion for others worldwide who are separated due to physical barriers. This reflects an understanding of the interconnection of migration issues globally, as many migrants have referred to others as nuestra familia migrante (our migrant family).",https://confluencenter.arizona.edu/sites/default/files/2025-01/redclothing.png,El Corrido de Juanito (Juanito’s Ballad),El desierto y la soledad (The desert and loneliness),"A man from Mexico describes his painting as symbolizing the desert and the deep loneliness experienced by migrants on their journey towards safety and a better path and having to leave their loved ones behind. The desert represents the difficult and dangerous path that migrants must travel to seek better opportunities in “El Norte” [the north]. He emphasized the word loneliness, conveying a sense of solitude leaving loved ones. This emphasizes the emotional impact of loneliness, highlighting the psychological suffering that migrants undergo. He devoted a great amount of time to work on his piece, displaying intense focus and appearing deeply reflective throughout the process of creating his painting. He mentioned the following upon completion of his artwork: “Me sentí bien al realizar esta actividad. Sentí alegría en que me ayudó a pensar y sentirme satisfecho con las decisiones tomadas.” [I felt good doing this activity. I felt joy. It helped me think and feel satisfied with the decisions I made (regarding his migration)].",https://confluencenter.arizona.edu/sites/default/files/2025-01/desertandloneliness.png,Los peligros de migración (The Dangers of Migration),Nunca se nos va olvidar (We will never forget),"During the sharing phase of this arts-based activity, most participants remained for our convivencia, however two chose to depart early. One participant, who had maintained a very quiet demeanor throughout the art creation process, was not able to share her art. She confided in me that it was difficult for her to communicate her experiences. She described her artwork to me and asked that I share it with the group once she left the room. In figure 33, she described the horrifying acts committed by the cartel against her uncle, witnessed by both her and her family. She wrote: “Lo que nosotros vivimos en carne propia, fue que en mi casa levantaron a mi tío y lo descuartizaron en pedacitos, le cortaron los pies, manos, orejas lo hicieron cachitos y nosotros estábamos con vida por un milagro, por obra de Dios y eso nunca se nos va olvidar. Y luego nos vinimos por amenazas de muerte a mi persona y contra mis hijos por narcos. Y tengo mucho miedo. ?Por qué el gobierno no hace nada? En todo Mexico se vive la corrupción [What we experienced firsthand was that in my house they picked up my uncle and dismembered him into little pieces, they cut off his feet, hands, and ears, cut him into little pieces, and we were alive by a miracle through the work of God and that, we will never forget. And then we came because of death threats against me and against my children. And I'm very afraid. In all of Mexico, we live with corruption. Why doesn’t the government do anything?]. 
The woman did not feel comfortable sharing her drawing, perhaps due to the personal and distressing nature of her experience. She did want for me to share it with others in our makerspace to raise awareness about the dangers of migration and the need for the support of the Mexican government. Her call-out of the government suggests a frustration with the Mexican authorities and their unwilling to protect its citizens. Her drawing depicts the cruelty and horror endured by the cartel in Mexico; as well as the urgent need for systemic change and justice.
",https://confluencenter.arizona.edu/sites/default/files/2025-01/neverforget.jpg,Los peligros de migración (The Dangers of Migration),Desplazamiento (Displacement),"This artwork was created by a woman from Mexico who depicts an impressive scene of her community rushing to the bus station. She mentioned that these are families of all ages rushing in urgency to the bus station during displacement by the cartel and police. She mentioned this occurred to her and her family, who were suddenly forced to leave her home and could not gather much of their personal belongings. You can see the buses, symbolizing their means of escape, painted atop of the creative piece. She indicated that this activity served as a therapeutic outlet for her to talk about the emotions of fear and sadness she felt having to abruptly depart from her community. This painting sheds light on the realities of the chaos, desperation, and anguish experienced by those impacted by displacement. It also conveys that displacement affects individuals of all ages, as depicted by families of all ages in this creative piece.",https://confluencenter.arizona.edu/sites/default/files/2025-01/displacement.png,Los peligros de migración (The Dangers of Migration),Abandonado (Abandoned),"his art piece was created by a man from El Salvador. He shared that his mother, who had passed away in his homeland, was the only one who supported his gender identity. His father and brother did not accept this. He described a disturbing experience of being beaten by members of the Mara Salvatrucha gang in El Salvador, resulting in visible injuries, including broken teeth and wounds on his stomach, which he revealed by lifting his shirt. He further shared that the guías stripped him of everything he owned, leaving him stranded in the desert without food, water, or any belongings. He added that for two painful days, he endured the harsh desert conditions alone and later surrendered himself to border patrol. 
        In his artwork, he depicted himself within the hostile landscape of the desert, symbolizing the isolation and difficulty he faced during his journey. “Me abandonaron como un animal. Como si no valiera nada. Como basura. Mi vida no fue valorada.” [They abandoned me like an animal. Like I was worthless. Like trash. My life was not valued]. “El taller me ayudó a pensar en el peor momento que pasé en este camino y recapacitar que mi vida pudo terminar porque alguien no la valoró y la importancia que debo de tener antes de tomar una decisión que pueda afectar mi vida…y ayudó también a despejar mi mente y sentirme feliz. P.D. Muchas gracias.” The workshop helped me to think about the worst moment that happened on this path and to re-examine that my life could end because someone did not value it and the importance that I should have before making a decision that could affect my life...and it helped also to clear my mind and feel happy. P.S. Thank you]. 
        Overall, his artwork depicts insight to his lived experiences on the intersection of identity, violence, migration, and survival. The creative piece sheds light on his vulnerability at the hands of guías but also offers an insight to his resilience, courage, and survival skills.

",Mi nombre (My Name),"In the following poem, Kimberlyn begins her statement emphasizing that her identity is not solely defined by her name. Rather, she suggests that there is a difference between the name one is given at birth and the true essence of oneself. Her poem declares independence and self-reliance. You can see this when she writes “Soy una mujer que no depende de un hombre para ser feliz” [I am a woman who does not depend on a man to be happy] and “Ni quedarme en casa viendo mi vida pasar” [Nor even staying at home seeing my life pass by] which also alludes to the rejection of traditional gender roles. Her poem claims independence, empowerment, and a commitment to defining one's own life and happiness, regardless of social norms. She shared this thought before creating the poem: “Respeto al tiempo y paciencia de mi acimiento para la que esperaron poder llamarme Kimberlyn y mi identidad está en mí y no en mi nombre.” [I respect the time and patience of my birth for which they waited so they could name me Kimberlyn and my identity is in me and not my name].","Soy una mujer que no depende de un hombre para ser feliz, ni quedarme en casa ver mi vida pasar.”","I am a woman who does not depend on a man to be happy, nor even staying at home seeing my life pass by.",https://confluencenter.arizona.edu/sites/default/files/ElizabethGaxiola.jpg

However, when people are aware of their history through time and space, wonderful changes can happen. They realized they are part of something bigger.","My project uses this as the basis of its purpose: The objective is to record two videos with songs carefully chosen after specific research to clearly identify the characteristic link of the people from this border-zone through time. The videos will bring together musicians from both sides of the border, and the songs will be sung in the two languages (Spanish and English) using the words appropriate for each cultural identity. These videos will be edited so we can see images from both countries and the singers and musicians in their own atmospheres and circumstances.

“Being a Mexican woman looking for a path in music and arts, having a communion with a beautiful country that has given so much opportunities and opened doors for so many Latin people, it is important to know the background that links all of us as a unity and how the history has united us since the beginning of the civilization in this land,” said Peralta.
