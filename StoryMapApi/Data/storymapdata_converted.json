      "Summary": "The aim of this study was to explore if creative expression through arts-based experiences (poetry\",\" music\",\" painting\",\" drawing\",\" digital stories) assisted in the emotional and mental well-being of migrants\",\" at least temporarily\",\" while they were in these makerspaces of convivencia. This research was framed as qualitative arts-based research with ethnographic methods. This study centered on exploring the aspects of beauty in participants' experiences before migration\",\" during migration\",\" and while staying at the border. Nevertheless\",\" there were instances where migrants felt compelled to share the challenges and dangers associated with migration. Within these spaces of convivencia\",\" migrants were able to express and navigate their emotions through testimonios\",\" pláticas\",\" and artistic expressions."
