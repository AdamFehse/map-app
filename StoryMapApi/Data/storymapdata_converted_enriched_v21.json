      "description": "Migrants, asylum seekers, and refugees encounter profound challenges prior to leaving their home country, during their journeys, and upon arrival at their destination. When traveling through these spaces, they experience fear, uncertainty, despair, confusion, and other emotions. What outlets are they afforded to express these emotions? Would creative expressions, for example, through, poetry, creative writing, testimonios (testimonies/narratives), and pl\u00e1ticas (talks) provide them with opportunities to name and narrate their worlds? Do artistic undertakings create a healthier emotional and mental state for migrants and their loved ones? Can arts-based experiences at least temporarily free individuals from pain or desperation? Although media coverage of the \u201cmigrant experience\u201d has been extensive, it has not often included the voices of migrants themselves. These activities and testimonios will be explored in a virtual mode with migrant families awaiting their asylum interview, and who are now safe in their new communities.",

Working closely with the UA libraries and two community organizations, Madres Buscadoras and the Colibr\u00ed Center for Human Rights, this project will create an interactive website to highlight this work and explore forensics in the landscape of the borderlands. The site will feature three components: interviews with citizen-forensic experts, videography of the landscape in which they work, and a bi-national map displaying the GPS locations where they have found or identified human remains. This project will broaden the national and international understanding of the U.S.-Mexico borderlands by presenting a fully bi-national view of border related violence, and by making visible the leadership, expertise, and action on the part of those impacted. The story this project will tell is one about regular people in the borderlands who step up to do extraordinary work; who not only make visible violence occurring in the borderlands but also challenge the authority of the state by becoming forensic experts.",

      "description": "Borderland Migrations & Metaphors (BMM) is a creative inquiry that uses pl\u00e1ticas in combination with podcasting to produce trans-disciplinary stories of the U.S.-Mexico border. Pl\u00e1tica is an anti-colonial feminista methodology that prioritizes social relationships based on trust, mutual vulnerability, and reciprocity. This approach contrasts power relations that characterize the traditional dichotomy of researcher-subject. BMM creates a space for co- creating knowledge through conversational interviews with BorderLab fellows from 2021-2023. Fellows are invited to reflect on their projects; how they are currently thinking about borderlands as an identity, location, and idea; and how they have been changed by borderlands research. Interviewers and fellows co-theorize as they connect everyday lived experiences with their research process. BMM conversations are recorded in a studio, thematically analyzed, sound edited, and enhanced within an iterative process. The result is a series of five podcast episodes. The BMM project will enrich public scholarship on the U.S.-Mexico border through its collective voicing of distinct insights of BorderLab fellows, its use of sound as the primary medium in which to produce knowledge, and its accessibility within and beyond the academic community. Sama Alshaibi is Regents Professor of Art at the University of Arizona's School of Art and Director of the Racial Justice Studio at Arizona Arts. An interdisciplinary visual artist, her practice explores the notion of aftermath\u2014the fragmentation and dispossession that violates the individual and a community following the destruction of their social, natural, and built environment. Alshaibi is the 2023 Art Matters' Betty Parsons Fellow, a 2021 Guggenheim Fellow, and a 2024 Rockefeller Foundation Bellagio Center Resident. She has exhibited in numerous biennales and museums, including the 55th Venice Biennale, the 2020 State of the Art (Crystal Bridges Museum of Art, AK), the Museum of Modern Art (New York), Institut Du Monde Arabe (Paris) and Barjeel Foundation (U.A.E.), among others. In 2015, Aperture published her monograph Sama Alshaibi: Sand Rushes In.",

      "description": "The project MEMBRANA SEMIPERMEABLE proposes the creation of an immersive audiovisual installation and a performance piece that increase accessibility to available data about HIV/AIDS in the US/Mexico border employing cutting-edge tools for data visualization and documentary strategies. The project lends immediacy to a complex entanglement of physiological, sociopolitical, and anthropological matters related to the ongoing HIV/AIDS crisis. Health risks travel fluidly between borders. At the periphery of both countries\u2019 economies, the region is affected by systematic social and economic disparities that co-exist with institutional racism and structural violence. In Arizona alone, HIV incidence among White individuals has had a 64% decrease from 1988 to 2020, whereas Hispanic individuals have had a 49% increase in new infections during the same period. In response to a pressing intersectional matter, the project explores queer-mestiza/o-PLWH (person living with HIV) subjectivity merging lens-based and computational strategies for image generation. This CFP Mellon-Fronteridades Faculty Fellowship application requests funds for the installation and performance design, and for the presentation of the creative work to the Tucson community. Marcos Serafim is a Brazilian artist and researcher working with imaging, video and sound across theatrical exhibition, installation, and performance. His practice investigates social and political subjects while exploring their relations to technology with the goal of producing works that are socially relevant, critical, and poetic. These subjects include: the HIV/AIDS crisis; religious African-Brazilian minorities in rural Brazil; Haitian history of revolution and social calamity; and other religiously, racially, and sexually minoritized groups. His approaches include performative situations, material encounters with digitality, resignification of archival imagery, and critical engagement with subjects, contexts, and spaces. Serafim's practice brings awareness to material and social implications of media while praising sensorial and poetic capabilities to engage viewers in reflection and critical thinking. Serafim holds a BA in Film and Video from Parana State University in Brazil, an MA in Studio Art from Eastern Illinois University, and an MFA in Studio Art from Michigan State University.",

Working closely with the UA libraries and two community organizations, Madres Buscadoras and the Colibr\u00ed Center for Human Rights, this project will create an interactive website to highlight this work and explore forensics in the landscape of the borderlands. The site will feature three components: interviews with citizen-forensic experts, videography of the landscape in which they work, and a bi-national map displaying the GPS locations where they have found or identified human remains. This project will broaden the national and international understanding of the U.S.-Mexico borderlands by presenting a fully bi-national view of border related violence, and by making visible the leadership, expertise, and action on the part of those impacted. The story this project will tell is one about regular people in the borderlands who step up to do extraordinary work; who not only make visible violence occurring in the borderlands but also challenge the authority of the state by becoming forensic experts.",

To challenge this flood injustice, Belury have co-conceived a participatory dissertation project that leverages satellite imagery and collaboration with community-based, flood justice advocacy organizations. This project focuses on two regions of the US-Mexico border: Nogales, Sonora/Nogales, Arizona (Ambos Nogales), and the Rio Grande/Rio Bravo Delta of the Texas-Tamaulipas border. The digital humanities can improve the impact of this project, transcend the disciplinary boundaries of flood mapping, and further engage local stakeholders and the public. With the 2023 Mellon-Fronteridades Graduate Fellowship Belury will produce and host the podcast Flood Justice in the Borderlands. This bilingual podcast will be conducted in English, then repeated in Spanish, thus communicating this information to bilingual audiences. Belury will host and produce one podcast on Ambos Nogales (English/Spanish) and one podcast in the Rio Grande/Rio Bravo Delta (English/Spanish), totaling four podcast episodes. In addition, Belury will develop a website to host the podcast series and the satellite flooding imagery Belury is generating. The website and accompanying satellite imagery will increase the communication of this project to the public and enhance the podcast experience by enabling listeners to visualize the scope and impact of these flood events. This bilingual podcast is also an opportunity to interview flood justice experts in the borderlands and share their knowledge with a broad and diverse audience.

Cordova will use this uncovering of language to interpret the agency of its material properties. Cordova wonders, what else does the material of the border wall desire to become instead of its current desecrated, masculine and phallocentric form? As a part of this project, Cordova will employ resistance strategies integral to the counter-narratives of his family\u2019s own oral histories. The oral history central to this endeavor is that of Cordova's uncle, who was a long-time labor activist and organizer beginning with the United Farm Workers in the 1960s and 70s. The interdisciplinary performance methodologies Cordova will employ to commune with the US/Mexico Border will evade rational understanding operating at sensorial and emotional registers. Cordova will screen the final 20-minute audio/video artwork locally in Tucson in a university setting. The screening will be followed by a community engagement discussion with group reflections.

      "description": "There is an abundance of literature on foodways at the U.S-Mexican border, yet there is no concise documentation of Mexican convenience stores or \u201cmercados'' in the southwest borderlands. This project aims to register how mercados across the border recreate their spaces, resources, and define symbolic and cultural ties to their communities. The documentation of Mexican ethnic stores has considerable implications, for one; mapping out access to different food systems which can culturally determine terms of quality, nutrition, knowledge, and a sense of belonging to one's community. In this sense, the goal of this project represents a matter of political, environmental, community health, and the importance of cultural spaces, and to explore its relation to commodity consumption of ethnic products. Through such documentation will be produced a website that will register mercados, essentially creating a cultural mapping of such spaces along the southwest border and telling their stories of how they came to be. In this context this project will point to understanding how mercados construct through symbolic, material (food and resources), the integration of these communities in their cultural surroundings, especially in border-spaces. This project will document these crucial spaces, by interrogating, how do communities in the southwest border (re)produce their cultural identities through commodity consumption, and based on this, what else is being consumed beyond the foods and materials sold in mercado spaces? Further exploring the relationship between Mexican identity and mercados and the production's experience and knowledge at the southwest border.

My work brings to life the experience of being a young, bilingual prisoner with a multi-ethnic identity split by a transnational boundary between the U.S. and Mexico, highlighting the fraught interracial dynamics of prison society, colloquially known as \u201cprison politics.\u201d A prime example is the distinction made between Paisas, or Mexican nationals, who are categorized as a different \u201crace\u201d than Raza, or Chicanos. This racial distinction, thrown into stark relief by the tension and rivalry between Raza and Paisas in prison, is impossible to reproduce in free society. Arizona\u2019s prison culture illuminates the way that transborder ethnic identities are refracted through the lens of carceral spaces. Through autoethnographic methods of (re)locating memory as a deeply place-based experience, Olivares-Pelayo work examines the narrative of not only my own incarceration, but the stories that frame punishment and justice in the Sonoran Borderlands. Enrique Alan Olivares-Pelayo is a bilingual Tucsonan and first-generation Mexican-American. His extended family hails from Mexicali, Baja California, with roots that go back to Jalisco, Mexico.

Despite extensive literature on migration on the U.S/ Mexico border, little attention has been paid to how migrant shelters can be viewed as pedagogical and transformative spaces of learning and activism. The 2023 Mellon-Fronteridades Graduate Fellowship will enable Sandoval to research the roles pedagogy and activism play within migrant shelters in Sonora, Mexico. Sandoval will spend time at various migrant shelters in Sonora and engage with the centers as pedagogical sites. She will examine the roles that knowledge sharing and learning play within migrant shelters. This research has potential for better understanding larger themes within transborder spaces and education. Sandoval's culminating projects will include 1) spatial analysis and mapping of learning practices that occur within migrant shelters in Sonora, Mexico 3)curated literacy materials for migrant shelters in Sonora, Mexico 3) professional development materials for K- 12 educators 4) a future article for dissertation and publication.

Although there is growing attention drawn to Asian Americans in Latin American studies, the studies specifically on language, race, and identity issues of Chinese Americans in the borderlands have been relatively limited. Chinese Americans living in this area have been discriminated against throughout history. Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, Sinophobia has been reignited worldwide, including in both the United States and Mexico. Amid this unprecedented era, this project focuses on how K-12 Chinese American students construct and navigate their identities through their daily interactions with people in the borderlands. This project provides an empirical and timely account of the translingual, transcultural, and transracial experiences of the young generation of Chinese Americans. This project also investigates how people of other races perceive and position these young Chinese Americans. It is important to recognize the presence of Chinese Americans in the borderlands, not only because it covers the lacuna in the U.S.-Mexico border studies but also because the presence of Chinese Americans and the formation of communities impacted the larger Asian and Latin American communities nationwide and in Global Asia. The findings of the project will broaden the understanding of the lived experience in the U.S.-Mexico borderlands by presenting the research papers published in journals or conferences.

      "title": "Native Americans & The Border Wall",
      "description": "In November 1989, the Berlin Wall came crashing down. Almost everybody in the world cheered loudly. However, within five years of its fall, the United States started building their own wall at the U.S.-Mexico border. For the past twenty-five years, a wrought-iron railing the color of blood has kept rising on top of what before was just a symbolic ranch-style fence line separating the two countries. In a few years, the harmless fence turned into a sinister 30-feet steel wall with strings of concertina wire stretched toward the sky, covering about 800 miles of the 2000-mile border. The billions of dollars spent in its construction could have supported education, healthcare, or the environment instead. The militarized structure harms some of the richest wildlife communities and oldest human settlements in North America: the wall cuts through the tribal homelands of at least seven Native American Nations in the United States, and several indigenous peoples in Mexico, separating tribe members from their relatives, sacred sites, and natural environments. Every day since the wall has been standing, people on both sides have been traveling to meet, talk, eat, touch hands, and even kiss through the openings in the iron bars. \u201cNative Americans & The Border Wall\u201d wishes to be a 15-20 minutes documentary that investigates the social, cultural, human, and environmental harm that the construction of the physical border wall has brought to the native peoples\u2019 lives and homelands along the entire Southwest Border. Natasha Cortinovis is a master\u2019s student in the Bilingual Journalism Program at the University of Arizona, and a Spanish Graduate Teaching Assistant. She previously earned an MA in TESOL, and a Spanish/Latin American Literature Certificate at the University of West Virginia, and an MA in Languages' Teaching at the University Of Aosta Valley (Italy). From Northern Italy, Natasha is also a hiking guide in the Italian Alps, a fond traveler and an outdoor enthusiast. She wishes to translate books from Slovak into English, become a Diving Instructor and a Journalist for underserved communities, the environment and wildlife.",

      "description": "The landscape of reproductive care in Arizona lacks providers and clinics, restricts access to services and care, and imposes fees that reduce reproductive autonomy, disproportionately impacting communities marginalized by their race, gender, sexuality, ability, citizenship status, and class. In response, birthworkers \u2013 non-medical birth companions who provide informational, physical, and emotional support to people during abortions, pregnancy, birth, and the postpartum period \u2013 are mobilizing to address gaps in reproductive healthcare provision. The Cihuapactli Collective in Tucson, Arizona is a group of Indigenous, Black, and Latinx birthworkers who offer full-spectrum reproductive care in their communities while cultivating mutual support amongst each other. Increasing the collective\u2019s visibility has urgent implications; sharing knowledge creates reproductive care options and fosters community belonging by offering a model of solidarity building that can expand autonomy and access for marginalized communities. With the 2024 Mellon-Fronteridades Graduate Fellowship, I will collaborate with the Cihuapactli Collective to organize a visual-narrative exhibition that introduces Tucson to local birthworkers through photography and personal narratives about their relationship with birthwork. This project transcends disciplinary boundaries, blending art and storytelling to increase birthworker visibility and public engagement. It will practically advance understandings of the causes and responses to reproductive (in)justice in the U.S.-Mexico borderlands by documenting how birthworkers leverage ancestral and learned knowledges to enact community care. Overall, this collaborative exhibition will highlight the histories, heritages, and sociopolitical environments of individuals who join a collective to alleviate gaps in reproductive health care provision. Deyanira Ibarra (she/they) is a Chicana birthworker and sociocultural anthropology Ph.D. student at the University of Arizona with research interests at the intersection of reproductive autonomy, landscapes of care, and networks of solidarity in the U.S.-Mexico borderlands. Deyanira\u2019s approach to research and the co-production of knowledge is informed by lived- experiences, Black feminist theories, and Indigenous feminisms. Deyanira completed their B.A. in Women\u2019s and Gender Studies at Wellesley College and M.S. in Narrative Medicine at the University of Southern California.",

      "description": "As climate change has become a prominent topic in mainstream media there is not enough attention on documenting climate migration. Climate migration is the movement driven by the impact of sudden or gradual climate-exacerbated disasters. My project will consist of documenting the movement of migrants who are displaced because of climate-related disasters. The project will use multimedia components such as audio, video, and photography to humanize these issues. I will also be using data and interviewing climate scientists to understand the science behind climate change. Additionally, I want to highlight the various push and pull factors that climate migrants are enduring and how it impacts them when they migrate to the Nogales, Sonora border. Alexandra Mora Medina is a Master of Arts student in the Bilingual Journalism Program at the School of Social Behavior at the University of Arizona. She was born in Phoenix, Arizona, and raised in Tolleson, Arizona. She is of Mexican descent. She graduated with a bachelor's degree in journalism and mass communication from the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication at Arizona State University in May 2022. During her undergraduate degree, she was a sustainability reporter and worked with environmental nonprofit groups where her passion for climate justice began. Alexandra is a passionate storyteller. Her focus has been on audio journalism covering community and environmental issues. She has been published in The Latino Reporter, KJZZ, and Cronkite News. As an academic, she is interested in Latinx News Media, Environmental Justice, and the Borderlands.

      "description": "The copious theorization on the logics of migration does not tell us why we have a sudden surge of population from as far away as India crossing the Arizona-Mexico border. Is journeying to the other side of the world, from \u2018periphery\u2019 to \u2018core\u2019, enough to alter their structural positionality in the world-system? What is their story that convinces them to embark on such a treacherous journey? Why are they leaving documents with which their identities can be reconstructed along the militarized border? Understanding the answers to these questions is significant because \u201cthe personal is international\u201d and making feminist sense of this international investigation is a push towards informing feminist policy and pedagogy. Between borders moving over people and people moving over borders, there is a pedagogy of migration that is being shaped, written, and practiced by migrants from the global south. It is a pedagogy of abundant hope, agency, resistance, and social transformation, and is feminist in its counterhegemonic pushback against systemic inequality. This Participatory Action Research explores how migrants from the global south reshape the world as they write their own pedagogies into the liminal space of the southwest borderlands. This project will deliver: 1. a digital story to challenge biased narratives, 2. an article to inform feminist policy and pedagogy, and 3. arts-based artefacts authored by migrants, which might be put on an interactive feminist exhibition. The vision is to co-create spaces of healing and agency as migrants write their own humanizing feminist narratives. Sanjukta Sarkar is a South Asian feminist and third-year interdisciplinary PhD scholar in Teaching, Learning, and Sociocultural Studies at the University of Arizona. She holds a Masters in English Literature from the University of Calcutta. As a former English and Public Speaking teacher in India, she worked with diverse groups, including resilient youth through the English Access Microscholarship Program, funded by the U.S. Department of State, which laid the groundwork for her research. Presently, she studies the intersections of critical pedagogy and global migration using decolonial feminist, ethnographic, and participatory frameworks.

      "description": "After September 11th, 2001, the United States government set borders and unauthorized migration as central themes to national security. Shortly thereafter, with the start of the war against drugs in 2006 by the Mexican government and the onset of the Great Recession in 2007, the United States strengthened measures to control unauthorized migration, violence at the Mexico-U.S. border and the havoc caused by the recession. Consequences have included the increased budget for the extension of the border wall and border surveillance; further restrictions for border crossing that have fragmented border communities; and the implementation of stricter anti-immigrant rhetoric and laws that criminalize clandestine border crossing and facilitate the removal of unauthorized migrants. This project explores how local dynamics among residents, organizations and authorities have been reconfigured since the beginning of the 2000s in Nogales Sonora/Arizona borderlands. Through interviews with local and non-local organizations and inhabitants, this work explores abrupt and gradual changes in local dynamics continuities and terminations of local and binational projects, the increase in violence in the region, the impact of growing in-transit migration, the initiatives that have arisen, and the participation or not of the local and non-local populations. This work not only informs us on how the reconfigurations in the Nogales Sonora/Arizona have affected the dynamics of the people living and working in the region, but also contributes to conversations about how to support positive responses to the current situation.",

Through the active listening and transcription of a dream archive, I have discovered the recurrent description of scenes related to family archetypes, border community struggles, gender issues and the persecution of necro-violent monsters. Through the dream archive research I will create a visual and textual lexicon that serves as both a manual and methodological framework for mapping an specific sensible political landscape: A US-Mexico Border region during the period of 2013 to 2020. This lexicon mapping practice aims to address the question of how we can translate our dreams into material forms \u2014texts, imaging, objects, in order to be able to speak and discuss from a personal background about the manifestations of fears and desires that intersect our sensible experience as subjects. The dream archive is based on my life experience as a young woman who has lived her life on the US-Mexico border. Generating knowledge from the female experience of the global south by applying a sensitive and intimate technique is an epistemic decolonial effort.",

This will contribute to an often-omitted history of cross-border popular expressions between Mexico and New Mexico in the nineteenth century. This study bridges interdisciplinary approaches of both archival and Spanish language recovery to expand border learning in the SHL classroom. The study is twofold. One, it works to recover the indita genre from the archives at the Center for Southwest Research at the University of New Mexico (UNM) and the Guti\u00e9rrez-Hubbell Collection, both located in Albuquerque. The study will re-historicize the cross-border connections between New Mexico and Mexico through the indita genre and will contribute to borderlands scholarship with the creation of a manuscript for the Journal of Arizona History. Secondly, the study will create a digital story for intermediate heritage language students. This digital story will serve as a model for both recovery efforts during a pandemic and as a model for students to create their own digital story focused on borderlands oral traditions, popular culture and identity in the SHL classroom. I anticipate an outcome of community-driven learning rooted in social justice in which students are able to critically think about their own positionality in Arizona-Sonora cross-border dynamics through oral traditions and popular performances.",

One of the aims is to create an open resource in the form of a website with these multimodal narratives. These narratives will be part of course assignments, which until now, have followed a traditional essay style. Instead, for the purpose of this research project, these assignments will be redesigned using a multimodal approach. A multimodal narrative is a way of composing that does not privilege just the linguistic form. Using this approach, students will have the opportunity to express their cultural and linguistic diversities through multiple modes (texts, sounds, visuals, movements and gestures). The multimodal nature of these narratives will have the potential to blossom multilingual ways of creating meaning by students, which sometimes can be difficult to achieve through traditional composing pedagogies. The process of developing their narratives, followed by the recognition they will receive by being displayed to the public, will honor the students\u2019 life experiences, their family ties, their communities and culture.",
